"""Execution-lifecycle state machine.

Per spec §2.2. All transitions go through this module; direct updates
to executions.status from elsewhere are a bug. The module:

- Defines the allowed (from, to) pairs as a set-based table.
- Validates transitions at call time.
- Owns the SQLite-write + catalog-sync path (with sync_pending
  soft-fail on catalog failure).
- Provides the disagreement-resolution logic used by just-in-time
  reconciliation in resume_execution.

Why a module and not a class: the state machine is functional —
transitions take (store, catalog, rid, target, metadata). The
ExecutionStateStore and ErmrestCatalog live elsewhere; this module
wires them together without owning lifecycle of either.
